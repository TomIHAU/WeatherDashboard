## Description
weather dashboard, using local storage and webapi to display the weather on the searched city for five days. 
saves the past five searchs.

## Known issue
The current response for searching melbourne seems to prioritize the city in the US rather than australia. 
which makes the response for time and weather incorrect for someone searching from Melbourne in Australia.
